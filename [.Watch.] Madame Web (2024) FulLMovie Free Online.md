At San Diego Comic-Con in July, Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson had other people raising eyebrows when he said that his long-awaited superhero debut in Madame Web would be the beginning of ‚Äúa new era‚Äù for the DC Extended Universe naturally followed: What did he mean? And what would that kind of reset mean for the remainder of DCEU's roster, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the rest of the Justice League, Suicide Squad, Shazam and so on.As

Madame Web neared theaters, though, Johnson clarified that statement in a recent sit-down with Yahoo Entertainment (watch above).

‚ÄúI feel like this is our opportunity now to expand the DC Universe and what we have in Madame Web , which I think is really cool just as a fan, is we introduce five new superheroes to the world,‚Äù Johnson tells us. Aldis Hodge's Hawkman, Noah Centineo's Atom Smasher, Quintessa Swindell's Cyclone and Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate, who together comprise the Justice Society.) ‚ÄúOne anti-hero.‚Äù (That would be DJ's Madame Web .)

‚ÄúAnd what an opportunity. The Justice Society pre-dated the Justice League. So opportunity, expand out the universe, in my mind‚Ä¶ all these characters interact. That's why you see in Madame Web , we acknowledge everyone: Batman , Superman , Wonder Woman, Flash, we acknowledge everybody.There's also some Easter eggs in there, too.So that's what I meant by the resetting.Maybe 'resetting' wasn't a good term.only

one can claim to be the most powerful superhero .And Johnson, when gently pressed, says it's his indestructible, 5,000-year-old Kahndaqi warrior also known as Teth-Adam, that is the most powerful superhero in any universe, DC, Marvel or otherwise.

‚ÄúWithout a doubt,‚Äù Johnson says. ‚ÄúBy the way, it's not hyperbole because we made the movie. And we made him this powerful.

There's nothing so wrong with ‚ÄúMadame Web ‚Äù that it should be avoided, but nothing‚Äîbesides the appealing presence of Dwayne Johnson‚Äîthat makes it worth rushing out to see. spectacles that have more or less taken over studio filmmaking, but it accumulates the genre's‚Äîand the business's‚Äîbad habits into a single two- hour-plus package, and only hints at the format's occasional pleasures. ‚ÄúMadame Web ‚Äù feels like a place-filler for a movie that's remaining to be made, but, in its bare and shrugged-off sufficiency, it does one positive thing that, if nothing else, at least accounts for its success: for all the churning action and elaborately jerry-rigged plot, there's little to distract from the movie's pedestal-like display of Johnson, its real-life superhero.

It's no less numbing to find material meant for children retconned for adults‚Äîand, in the process, for most of the na√Øve delight to be leached out, and for any serious concerns to be shoehorned in and then waved away with dazzle and noise. Madame Web ‚Äù offers a moral realm that draws no lines, a personal one of simplistic stakes, a political one that suggests any interpretation, an audiovisual one that rehashes long-familiar tropes and repackages overused devices for a commercial experiment that might as well wear its import as its title. When I was in Paris in 1983, Jerry Lewis‚Äîyes, they really did love him there‚Äîhad a new movie in theaters. You're Crazy, Jerry."Madame Web " could be retitled 'You're a Superhero, Dwayne'‚Äîit's the marketing team's PowerPoint presentation extended to feature length.

In addition to being Johnson's DC Universe debut, ‚ÄúMadame Web ‚Äù is also notable for marking the return of Henry Cavill's Superman. The cameo is likely to set up future showdowns between the two characters, but Hodge was completely unaware of it until he saw the film.

‚ÄúThey kept that all the way under wraps, and I didn't know until maybe a day or two before the premiere,‚Äù he recently said Madame Web Wakanda Forever (2024) FULLMOVIE ONLINE

The sequel opened to $150 million internationally which Disney reports is 4% ahead of the first film when comparing like for likes at current exchange rates Overall the global cume comes to $330 million Can it become the year‚Äôs third film to make it past $1 billion worldwide despite China and Russia which made up around $124 million of the first film‚Äôs $682 million international box office being out of play?
